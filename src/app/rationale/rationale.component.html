                                When one thinks of creating an index, the obvious indices that come to mind are those focused on financial markets. 
                                Those can be straightforward – in the S&P 500 Index, the prices of the constituents are known as are the weights in 
                                the form of the free float of the stock. The S&P 500 Index is thus completely transparent, independent, and objective, 
                                with neither of the two variables controlled by those creating it. The Lehman/Barclays Global Aggregate and its 
                                sub-indices can be clearly defined in terms of what goes into constructing them, and both prices and issued quantities
                                are known as objective numbers. Yet not all financial indices enjoy the benefit of such clarity on both prices and weights. 
                                The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a price based index, but of 30 subjectively selected stocks; it is, of course, 
                                widely used, including as the basis of financial derivative contracts and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). The key feature in 
                                any index is consistency, which is what makes an index useful. Subjectivity in determining an index does not erode credibility 
                                so long as transparency and consistency are maintained.

                                For any financial index to be maximally useful, it should be tradable in some way. A group of people should be able to associate
                                 the value of the index with the financial well being of their portfolio, their business, or something that has economic relevance.
                                If trade-ability is not possible, then the index becomes an object of mere entertainment, cocktail conversations, and not much more.
                                It becomes like the daily number for humidity, or the Big Mac index, or something like the “smoothed-sunspot-number” (SSN) which 
                                while published daily is of interest only to an esoteric community.

                                <span>For an index to be “really useful,” it needs to be able to do the following two things at the very least:</span>
                                <mat-list-item>- Risk managers should be able to use the index to hedge their risks</mat-list-item>
                                <mat-list-item>- Investors should be able to take on exposure to the risks that the index incorporates,
                                     and be rewarded for taking on the risk by those who do not desire such risk.</mat-list-item>

                            <p>
                                The above are, needless to say, in addition to the basic requirements of objectivity, consistency, 
                                rule-based computation, and transparency which we consider a given.

                                Information security risks and financial risks differ in a number of fundamental ways that make achieving 
                                the above “economic objectives” difficult. While obvious, there is a need to explicitly recognize these 
                                differences. The lack of data on information security is a known matter, but it does not represent a 
                                fundamental or conceptually insurmountable issue. The past decade has shown indices being very usefully 
                                put together for risks that were for very long times not considered computable.

                                    The first challenge – the construction of the security index – is not trivial and poses rather difficult issues given the lack of credible data upon which to base it. Prices for the illegal underground markets are difficult to get, whether directly or otherwise. Third party sources may neither be dependable over a period of time, nor be credible. Primary collection of data by directly accessing chat rooms or contacts with people who are engaged in illegal activities will not only be time consuming and unreliable, it is also probably legally risky. Companies that do collect & publish data are quickly tire of the activity. One simply cannot rely on such sources of data; the externally-based data route for calculating a cybersecurity index leads (and has repeatedly led) to a dead-end.

                                <p>
                                    It is therefore proposed that the index be constructed using survey-based methodology. Survey based indices are common in the world of economics. Some of the most successful and reliable indicators of economic activity are survey based.

                                        The ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index

                                        The foremost is the Institute of Supply Management’s (ISM) Purchasing Manager Index (the PMI), which is published monthly and used with all seriousness by professional investors in guiding their decision making. The PMI is based upon a survey of about 300 purchasing managers, and different parts of the survey contribute to different “components” of the index. Each of the components is equally weighted to arrive at the overall PMI. The questions asked require non-numerical answers. For example, a question might be “Has the economic activity in question increased, decreased or remained the same?” The responses are converted to numbers using a method used for what are called “diffusion indices”. To quote an example verbatim from the ISM’s website, if the response is 20 percent “Better,” 70 percent “Same,” and 10 percent “Worse,” the Diffusion Index would be 55 percent (20% + [0.50 x 70%]). A reading of 50 percent indicates “no change” from the previous month, a reading of less than 50 indicates economic contraction, and a reading of more than 50 indicates expansion.

                                    <p>
                                        The PMI is one of the most influential economic indicators, and the fact that it is survey based does not diminish its credibility in any way. JP Morgan and Markit have collaborated with the ISM to produce what they call the “JPMorgan Global Services PMI”, which is a branded index backed by very respected market participants

                                        A variety of economic indicators published by the Conference Board are similarly based on a survey based methodology – an often quoted index being the Index of Consumer Confidence (CCI) which is based upon a survey of 5000 US households. They also publish a whole family of indices on the business cycle, labor markets etc.
                                        The University of Michigan also publishes a similar “University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index” which is based upon telephonic surveys of 500 respondents. Each of the above indicators have been around for many decades each, and are considered credible and concrete by business and government alike

                                            An index based on prices, botnet data, etc., is limited to certain kinds of risks. It will not cover newer risks that may arise, many of which may not have any price or attack data ever available – for example the risk of organized attacks on infrastructure by a sovereign nation. Or the risk of unsafe application development practices in the emerging world. A survey based approach can easily address such risks and any new risks that may arise.</span>

                                        We know (or can know, at least on a confidence interval basis) that a certain percentage of Junipers (picking on Juniper as an example) will be compromised causing some expected dollar loss. For the individual Juniper owner, the realized probability of the loss occurring will be binary – 0 or 1 – and not, for example, 0.03 ever. For the single company, the expected value is far less relevant than the worst case loss. Therefore what the Juniper owning company really wants is insurance, not unlike the house owner wanting to protect against fire. The only party truly exposed to the full distribution of the probability of house fires is the insurance company.
